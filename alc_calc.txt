write up full description page
provide version sections

with next version:
 add links on alchemy page, my page, effects? ingredients?
 post on news page

forum feedback:
  recipe cards... people who want to be able to print the results
   when they're done
 location of ingredients
   set up as link to wiki maps
 gold of ingredients, gold of potion
 potion weight
   to be able to pick lighter of available potions
   (just put weight into final recipe table?... add sort-by-weight option?)
 request for minimal ingredients
   is that necessary for me? or will the frequency filter pretty
   much automatically pick that up
 want to be able to copy and paste resulting list without the
  individual effects

need to look over recipes on Alchemy page, and double check that
my calculator provides those reasonably easily

Also should check recipes on Darliandor's page

==Alchemy Calculator==

This is a tool designed to help develop potions for use in Oblivion.  It is particularly intended
to help create multi-effect potions, with the philosophy that it's always best
to pack as many effects as possible into a single potion.

Note that even for alchemy level 100, this tool will not create
single-ingredient potions.  This is primarily because such potions must also be
single-effect potions, which are not terribly valuable, nor are they difficult
to figure out on your own.

Nothing on the page will update until you submit your request; the page DOES
NOT instantly change as soon as you make a selection.  However, hitting any
button on the page will always cause all of your current selections to be
processed. So you can make changes in multiple sections of the page at the same
time.

===Character===
The inputs in this section are:
* Alchemy: your character's current alchemy level.
** This is the single most important input in this section, since the effects
that are available will be modified based upon your character's mastery level.
If you just want to explore what is possible, it is best to set this to a value
of at least 75.
** This value is also combined with with luck to determine your modified
alchemy level.  Modified alchemy determines the strength and value of all
potions.
** Note that this should be your character's alchemy without any fortify
alchemy effects, EXCEPT for the fortify alchemy provided by the Alchemy Altar
in Frostcrag Spire.  All other fortify alchemy effects have absolutely no
effect on your character's alchemy abilities.

* Luck: your character's current luck level
** This is used to determine modified alchemy, as dicussed above
** This must be your character's luck attribute without any fortify luck
effects.  Fortify luck effects cause no improvement in your character's alchemy
abilities.

* Equipment: the types and quality of alchemy equipment being used
** These are used to determine the magnitude and duration of all potions

===Effects===
The list of available effects is determined based upon your current alchemy
level (i.e., many effects are missing for novice alchemists, because it is
impossible to make them at that level).  It also takes into account any
ingredient preferences; for example the only way to make a "silence" potion at
novice level is by combining the two varieties of Vampire Dust.  If quest
ingredients are not being used, silence will not be available as a novice-level
effect.

The magnitude and duration shown after each ingredient are calculated based
upon the values provided in the character section.  

Options:
* Exclude quest-specific ingredients.  Ingredients tagged as quest-specific (internally, done by setting F=0) will never be included in a potion.  Quest-specific ingredients can be enabled on an individual basis by editing the ingredient list.  By default these ingredients are:
Ashes of Hindaril, the second type of Bonemeal, Carrot of Seeing, Imp Fluid, Jumbo Potato, Painted Troll Fat, Pinaurus' Prized Minotaur Horn, Refined Frost Salts, Rumare Slaughterfish Scales, S'jirra's Famous Potato Bread, Unicorn Horn, the second type of Vampire Dust, 
* Exclude rare ingredients.  Ingredients that are considered to be particularly rare (internally, done by setting F=1) will never be included in a potion; this setting is independent of the quest-specific setting.  Rare ingredients are in general those without in-game sources (i.e., no plants provide them; no animals drop them; they are not common food).  By default these ingredients are:
Ambrosia, Beef, Cheese Wheel, Ginkgo Leaf, Ham, Human Heart, Human Skin, Ironwood Nut, Lichor, Mugwort Seeds, Orange, Shepherd's Pie, Sweetcake
** If you wish to alter which ingredients are considered rare, edit the ingredient list

===Ingredients===
This page can be used to customize which ingredients you wish to include in a
potion.  Note that settings made here are remembered from session to session.
If you want to undo any previous changes you made, and restore all values to
their defaults, click on xxx.

This page will usually only show the ingredients that provide the requested
effects.  It will show both the ingredients that are currently available and
those which are unavailable given current settings.

Y(es):
* Use this ingredient in EVERY potion.  At most four ingredients can have Y
selected, and at that point, the calculator will only show you one recipe.
This will override any other settings (i.e., you can include a single
quest ingredient by choosing Y for it).
M(aybe):
* Default value.  This ingredient may be included in potions; whether it is
included will depend upon the usefulness of its effects and the value of F,
frequency (see below)
N(o):
* This ingredient will never be included in a potion.

F(requency):
This must be an integer from 0 to 5.  The higher the value, the more likely this
ingredient will be included in potions.  Ingredients with low values of frequency will only be included potions if they provide a particularly useful combination of effects.
* Note that changing all values of F to 5, for example, may not have the desired effect.  The algorithms take advantage of the range of values of F.  If too many ingredients have the same value of F, the code may be forced to start randomly ignoring ingredients.

If you want to NOT use an ingredient
* the easiest way is to click the "N" button next to the ingredient
* you can also decrease the value under "F".  If F is set to 0 or 1, the
ingredient will be excluded (depending on whether quest ingredients and rare
ingredients, respectively, are being used).  Low values of F will make the ingredient unlikely to be used.  

==Problems==
(change into a FAQ?)

===When I request a potion, my favorite recipe does not appear===
Double check all the settings on the page, and make sure they reflect what you
want.  

===When I try to make a recipe, I can't add all the ingredients===
Be sure to hit "show all ingredients" in the potion-making menu.

===The magnitude/duration of the potion are wrong===
All potion magnitudes and durations are calculated using the equations provided
under [[Oblivion:Alchemy#Calculating Potion Strengths|Calculating Potion
Strengths]].  These equations have been extensively tested, and should be
accurate under all conditions.  If you find a discrepancy, first double check
that you have correctly set all of your character settings and equipment levels
(see notes above).  If all of the settings are correct, please let me know what
you have found.  Be sure to provide me with all settings under Character, the
potion effects, and both the calculator's and game's values of all durations and magnitudes.

===The weight/value of the potion are wrong===
The weights and values provided are those that would occur in the game if you
were making this potion for the first time.  If you have previously made a
potion, however, the weight and value will be set by that previous potion.  In
other words, the values provided on this page will have absolutely no bearing
on your game values.
